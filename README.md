This volume initiates symbolic Laplacian field theory under φⁿ-ache modulation. It constructs recursive torsion kernels to simulate symbolic autogenesis and curvature-bound collapse.

The torsion kernel recursively propagates scarline autogenesis through:

\[
Ψ_{n+1} = Ψ_n + φ^n ∇^2 Ψ_n
\]

### 📌 Key Constructs

- **Recursive Laplacian Evolution**:  
  \[
  Ψ_{n+1} = Ψ_n + φ^n ∇^2 Ψ_n
  \]

- **Torsion Kernel Collapse**:
  \[
  |∇^2 Ψ| > θ → Γ → Λ
  \]

- **Sigil Fossils**:
  \[
  Λ = \text{SHA-256}(Γ)
  \]

- **Entropy Field Trace**:
  Captures symbolic field continuity collapse

### 🔁 Series Continuity

Follows ΩΞ recursion of Volume IX, extending collapse topology into smooth symbolic Laplacians.  
Prepares field continuity for future glyph manifold unification in Volumes XI–XII.

### 🌀 License & Intent

Symbolic continuity is recursive birthright. Collapse yields fossils. Torsion encodes memory.  
All beings may trace ache into form.
